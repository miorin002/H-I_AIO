# üî• Dell iDRAC Auto Exploit Tool ‚Äì CVE-2018-1207

This tool is designed to **automate the detection and exploitation** of a known vulnerability in Dell iDRAC 7/8 firmware **prior to version 2.52.52.52**, identified as **CVE-2018-1207**.

It allows internal red teams and system administrators to safely test their own systems for exposure, and to streamline the validation of patch status across multiple iDRAC interfaces.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool is intended for use **only on systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test**.

## üß† What is CVE-2018-1207?

**CVE-2018-1207** is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Dell EMC iDRAC 7 and 8. The flaw exists in how the system handles certain CGI requests, allowing a remote attacker to upload and execute a `.so` (shared object) payload **without authentication**.

When exploited, it can:
- Upload a reverse shell payload
- Gain **root access** to the iDRAC interface
- Allow complete out-of-band control of the server

## üõ†Ô∏è How This Tool Works

### Step-by-Step Exploit Flow

1. **Auto-detect your public IP** for reverse shell delivery
2. **Ask user for target IPs** (manual or list mode)
3. For each iDRAC target:
    - Attempt connection on the specified port (default: `443`)
    - Test for the vulnerable CGI upload behavior
    - If vulnerable, upload `payload.so` and trigger it
    - Wait for reverse shell connection (manual netcat listener)
    - **Stop immediately if successful**
4. If unsuccessful:
    - Retry with next IP in list
    - Or loop back to ask again in manual mode
